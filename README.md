# Instructions
  - To start you will use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

  - Next you will need to create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs.
    - For the values on the bar chart use sample_values
    - For the labels on the bar chart use otu_ids
    - For the hovertext on the bar chart use out_labels

  - Next you will need to create a bubble chart that will display each sample.
    - For the x values use otu_ids
    - For the y values use sample_values
    - For the marker size use sample_values
    - For the marker colors use otu_ids
    - For the text values use otu_labels
   
- After both charts are completed, display the sample metadata, then display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
- You will need to update all plots when a new sample is selected. Use any layout you desire for your dashboard.


# Assistance
- For this weeks challenge I used my tutor session to help me get started in this project. After my tutoring session I was able to get most of the dashboard complete, but used ask BCS for some slight labeling assistance on my bar chart.
